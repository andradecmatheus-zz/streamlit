# Streamlit Projects

Compilation of Streamlit projects where I practice these skills.

## [my-awesome-streamlit-front-end](my-awesome-streamlit-front-end)
It's a beginner level Streamlit tutorial where I watched from [Mısra Turps’ youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IM3531b1XU&list=PLM8lYG2MzHmTATqBUZCQW9w816ndU0xHc). You can reach the professor's project [here](https://share.streamlit.io/misraturp/my-awesome-streamlit-front-end/main.py) and her github repository [here](https://github.com/misraturp/my-awesome-streamlit-front-end).

I made a small adjustment. Instead of the user typing the input feature, I put the columns inside a box selector to be selected one column as input feature.

## [streamlit_freecodecamp](streamlit_freecodecamp)

It's a result from Streamlit tutorial named "Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course" on  [freecodecamp.org' youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&t=841s) where the course's goal is to learn how to build interactive and data-driven web apps in Python using the Streamlit library. You can reach the professor's github repository [here](https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit_freecodecamp).

For study purposes, I watched the course, reviewed the code, updated it, and made some minor changes.

## [ml-app-salaryprediction](ml-app-salaryprediction)

The project's goal is build a Machine Learning web application from scratch using Stremalit. You can reach the professor's github repository [here](https://github.com/python-engineer/ml-app-salaryprediction).

The project can be reach [here](https://share.streamlit.io/andradecmatheus/streamlit/main/ml-app-salaryprediction/app.pyhttps://share.streamlit.io/andradecmatheus/streamlit/main/ml-app-salaryprediction/app.py).
