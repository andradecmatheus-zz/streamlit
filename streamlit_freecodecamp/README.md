It's a result from Streamlit tutorial named "Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course" on  [freecodecamp.org' youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&t=841s). You can reach the professor's github repository [here](https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit_freecodecamp).

For study purposes, I watched the course, reviewed the code, updated it, and made some minor changes.
